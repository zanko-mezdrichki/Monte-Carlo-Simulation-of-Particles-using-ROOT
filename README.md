# 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation of Particles using ROOT

The program aims to simulate, represent and analyze the content of physical events generated by collisions of elementary particles.
They are distinguished by some fundamental properties: mass, charge and the width of the γ resonance, linked to the average life period; 

In addition to these characteristics, particles are also described by kinematic properties, i.e. the components (P_x, P_y, P_z) of the pulse.

The particles taken into consideration are Pyons, Kaons, Protons, Antiprotons and neutral Kaons.

The program was developed with the C++ programming language, implementing the ROOT data analysis software.

It was possible to generate the particles, their fundamental properties and their behavior following collisions through the definition of specific classes and methods.
For the generation in each event, the Monte Carlo method was used in order to respect certain proportions.

For the results obtained, see the file **lab2025.pdf**.

It was a group project carried out during the Electromagnetism and Optics laboratory course of the Bachelor's degree in Physics at UNIBO.
